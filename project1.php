<h1> Octocopter</h1>
<p> 

IEEE is working on an Octocopter (8 rotor drone) for year 2016-2017. 
The Autonomous Octocopter Drone project focuses on giving students hand's on experience applying techniques from electrical engineering and computer science. Students will get a chance to design, build and fly a drone that will have video feed capabilities and other features and it will be controlled by an Arduino microcontroller. 
Eventually students will be able to enter drone industry.
